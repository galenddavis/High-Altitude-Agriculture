# Background

The year is 2065 and you are the final surviving memeber of the ISS 2.0. You're still in orbit about an uninhabitable planet Earth. Your food should last your for nearly 3 more weeks, but resources are dwindling and machinery is starting to break down. Low Orbit Agriculture is a relaxing farming simulator where failure means death. How long can you keep your crops, and yourself, alive in the face of dire circumstances. 

# Functionality & MVPs

While playing this game, the user will be able to:

* Control their character and move them around their small ship. 
* Plant seeds and tend to their existing plants. 
* Monitor oxygen levels that will decline and grow based on the status of their crops. 

# Technologies and Libraries

This game will largely be built in vanilla JS along with HTML Canvas and CSS to provide the visuals. 
* Javascript will be responsible for all of the logic heavy lifting going into the game in terms of the oxygen levels increasing or decreasing based on greenery levels. 
* HTML Canvas will be used to display the ship layout and character from a top down level, as well as the oxygen monitor. 
* ScSS will be used to style the remaining elements of the page outside of the game including the title bar, as well as the creator information and social/professional profile links. 

### Challenges

* I fully anticipate challenges with Canvas as it's a new technology that I have not used before. 
* Handling constant user input and character movement isn't something that I've ever done before, so I'm anticipating having to spend some time researching that as well. 
* I am not fully sure of how the styling works for something inside a canvas so I'm looking forward to that as well.

* Begin to implement planting mechanic. 

### Day 3

* Finish the planting mechanic. 
* Figure out how to implement oxygen levels that rise and fall.
* Begin to brainstorm sprites/visuals for the game.

### Day 4

* Continue to wrap up any leftover functionality. 
* Add my personal links and style them.
