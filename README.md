# Background

The year is 2065 and you are the final surviving memeber of your crew. You're still in orbit about an uninhabitable planet. Your food should last your for nearly 3 more weeks, but resources are dwindling and machinery is starting to break down. Low Orbit Agriculture is a relaxing farming simulator where failure means death. How long can you keep your crops, and yourself, alive in the face of dire circumstances. 

# Functionality & MVPs

While playing this game, the user will be able to:

* Control their character and move them around their small ship. 
* Plant seeds and dig up plants.
* Monitor oxygen levels that will decline and grow based on the amount of crops. 

# Technologies and Libraries

This game will largely be built in vanilla JS along with HTML Canvas and CSS to provide the visuals. 
* Javascript will be responsible for all of the logic heavy lifting going into the game in terms of the oxygen levels increasing or decreasing based on greenery levels. 
* HTML Canvas will be used to display the ship layout and character from a top down level, as well as the oxygen monitor. 
* ScSS will be used to style the remaining elements of the page outside of the game including the title bar, as well as the creator information and social/professional profile links. 

### Challenges

* Understanding how to draw on a canvas and use requestAnimationFrame in order to get a looping animation.. 
* Handling constant user input and character movement. 
* Developing and creating a github pages deployment.
